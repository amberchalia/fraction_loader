# Subproject 1.5: Sequential Fraction Assembly

This C program simulates handling multiple data fractions, allocating a final executable buffer with VirtualAlloc and PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions. It creates and parses simulated fractions with headers, copies payloads to the correct offsets, and verifies the result. Windows-specific, it uses winhttp.lib and debug output for tracing, with proper cleanup via VirtualFree.
