# Subproject 1.4: Allocating Executable Memory

This C program demonstrates allocating a contiguous executable memory buffer using Windows API's VirtualAlloc with PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permissions. It simulates a fraction payload, copies it into the buffer, and verifies the operation with debug output. The code ensures proper cleanup with VirtualFree and is Windows-specific, requiring winhttp.lib.
